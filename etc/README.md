The files in this directory are expected to be installed in their corresponding directories in the /etc directory. They include:
- bind: The portions of the DNS (named.service) configuation that does not chnage when the IPv6 prefix changes. They can be treated as "fixed" files and are included here only to present a complete example. Files like db.0, db.empty, and zones.rfc1918 are created during the installation of bind9 and are not included in this example.
- netplan: Includes an exmple YAML file for network configuration that ties in with the rest of the example. Notably, it defines the interfaces and that the (systemd-)networkd renderer is used
- networkd-dispatcher: Contains the routable.d directory of "parent" scripts that, in turn, run scripts from the opt (/opt) directory when the routable network status changes. That is, these scripts get run in order by name whenever the system is booted, the DHCP lease from Verizon expires, or some other condition may have caused the delegated prefix to have changed.
- systemd:  Exists only to house the network/10-netplan-enp2s0.network.d/override.conf directories and file. The override.conf contains the `SendRelease-false` DHCPv6 directive to NOT release the delegated prefix when the WAN interface is restarted. This results in the same delegated prefix being returned by Verizon's DHCP6 server for an extended period of time.
